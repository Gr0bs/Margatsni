## :clipboard: **About this project**

Learning React, I was searching about creating fun project and learning more stuff. So I find a good project video create by [Aleks Popovic](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu3RVedqyL5o776xyQlbyAw) where he explain step by step how to create the application **instagram**

## :bulb: **Why** 
React is one of the most utilised framework in the front-end environment. So.. If I want to find a job or create usefull website/App, there is no other option then learning React ! 
With react, we can create many application and re-use component easily. With this project I could understand how to do it properly.
